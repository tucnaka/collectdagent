# collectdagent

This program has been written to provide a simple set of metrics to
collectd servers using the collectd network protocol. An ideal example
is to run it on a host that sends metrics to an influx database.

A key design goal has been for the delivery of metrics that are
compatible with those generated by the collectd daemon so that
it is easy to integrate different sources of data into applications
such as graphite, Grafana, etc.

Current state of play:
* wire protocol correct
* built-in sending of cpu, disk and memory metrics matches format
  used by collectd
* can be installed and run as a Windows service
* using psutil means it runs equally well on Unix/Windows

Required work:
* develop a configuration file format
* develop a plugin infrastructure to allow incremental
  addition of modules that provide metrics
* support encryption for data sent over the network
* build a python package for use with pip
* take over the world
